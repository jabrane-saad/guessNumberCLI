# Small C Utility

A minimal C program built to practice core language fundamentals and establish consistent project completion habits.

This project is intentionally small. The goal is correctness, clarity, and finishing what was started.

## Purpose

- Practice writing clean, readable C
- Reinforce basic control flow, input handling, and standard library usage
- Maintain a growing history of completed, focused projects

## Features

- Single-purpose command-line program  
- No external dependencies (standard C library only)  
- Simple build and execution process  

## Build
>***make sure you are in the project dir***
```
make
```

## Run
```
./app
```

## Design Notes

- Kept intentionally small to avoid feature creep  
- Focus on correctness and clarity over complexity  
- Explicit error handling where applicable  

## Future Improvements

- Input validation improvements  
- Additional flags or options  
- Refactoring into multiple files if complexity grows
